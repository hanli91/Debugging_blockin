71,True Professionalism,"Maister, David H.",1,Hardcover,Simon & Schuster,9780684834665,1997,05,01,210,,ENG,"Professional firms are forever trying to get their people to act like professionals - to do the right things. Though their various incentives may create employee compliance, these don't often encourage excellence. Taking issue with such methods, David Maister, the world's premier consultant to professional service firms, vigorously challenges professionals to examine this essential, yet under-addressed question: What is true professionalism? Essentially, Maister argues, it is a personal commitment to self-betterment and a professional dedication to provide the best and most efficient service to clients. In clear, pragmatic terms, he convincingly advocates the ""power of principles"" - the most effective tools management can use to inspire excellence in individual performance. His core principles spring from good, sound logic: Believe passionately in what you do, never compromise your standards and values, and care about your clients. Do all of these because they are the ethical things to do and because they are the primary road to commercial success. In this candid treasury of practical wisdom, Maister expounds some eternal truths about the individual professional, the firm, and the client. He explains how to achieve true professionalism at both the micro and macro levels by answering many key but tough questions, including these: How do you develop a personal career strategy? How does a firm track the profitability of individual assignments? Can and should you guarantee your client's satisfaction? Looking first at the individual, Maister dares those good corporate citizens who ""do their duty"" to discover what they truly love to do, and then to align their real-world actions with their true values - and he tells them why a continual investment must be made in getting better. Turning to the firm, he focuses on what he calls its ""instability"" and offers advice on how to invest in skill-building. He explains why extra time invested in supervising reaps large financial benefits, and why excellence in client satisfaction should be an enforced standard. A brief example of the clear thinking and sound advice to be found in this handbook: Stress on maximizing billable hours may seem profitable, but instead it encourages employees to be inefficient, it loses the customer's trust and confidence, and eventually it hurts the firm's reputation and profit margin. The bottom line, according to the author? Act like a true professional and the money will follow. A consultant challenges professionals to closely examine the meaning of their work and to reach beyond their grasp, and advises professional institutions that they should invest in skill building"

76,Bright College Years: Inside the American Campus Today,"Matthews, Anne",1,Hardcover,Simon & Schuster Books,9780684815411,1997,04,01,288,,ENG,"Presents a portrait of American campus life today   On one level, the world of higher education is still, as Matthews puts it, ""a chunk of the twentieth century dropped live and squabbling on the threshold of the twenty-first"". But behind the stately trees and lovely towers a powerful hidden life has taken root, as academe is buffeted by the same economic and demographic forces that are drastically reshaping the rest of society. What's going on in there? And while we're at it, what exactly, these days, is college for? Tracking and mapping the academic year, Matthews casts a searchlight in turn on those who learn, those who teach, and those who arrange, especially the makers and managers of money and image whose methods shape higher education more strongly every year. In the process, she goes behind the scenes at every type of school: enormous state universities like Texas or Arizona, where finding French class requires a map and a bus ticket; sleek country-club schools like Vanderbilt or USC, where student allowances can exceed faculty salaries; fiercely specialized colleges like Cal Tech, where students dream in computer languages; struggling trailer-house campuses like South Dakota's Sinte Gleska, the nation's first Native American university. Throughout, Matthews keeps in unsparing focus the conflicts between our competing images of what college is supposed to be: show business, rite of passage, profit machine, private planet, gateway to knowledge and power. Irreverent, engrossing, vastly entertaining, and intensely observed, Bright College Years is one veteran journalist's (and native daughter's) inside scoop on a beloved American institution in the grip of enormous change."

The careful arrangement of the contents of any room, from kitchen to office, can dramatically improve your health, finances, and relationships. Creating good feng shui can be as simple as moving your furniture, and as subtle as hanging a mirror or highlighting an auspicious color. Feng shui can be as personal as your own decorating taste: Once you set your goals and priorities - whether to improve family harmony or succeed in business - you can put feng shui to work especially for you. This easy-to-use room-by-room handbook provides tips for good feng shui in every part of your home, as well as simple cures for feng shui problems: If you have an interior staircase that directly faces your front door, good luck may be running directly out the door - and out of your life. A mirror on the landing of the stairs can draw in positive energy and circulate it around your home for better luck. For more restful sleep and better health, move your bed away from overhanging beams. A beam that cuts across a bed can create aches and pains in the parts of the body exposed to it - virtually ""cutting in half"" the life of the sleeper - and a beam that divides the bed between the sleepers can result in marital problems. Keep stove burners clean - clogged burners can block your income potential - and use all the burners regularly. The heat and energy passing through these openings will keep your family's business prospects from growing cold. Move your desk so it faces your office door, not the wall. If your back is to the door, you'll be surprised by people coming in - as well as by what they have tosay. Enhance your finances by placing a fish tank in your living room or office. The flow of water represents cash flow, and the fish symbolize abundant wealth - there are always more fish in the sea!"

154,Managing at the Speed of Change: How Resilient Managers Succeed and Prosper Where Others Fail,"Conner, Daryl R.",1,Hardcover,Random House Inc,9780679406846,1993,01,01,282,,ENG,"A business consultant shows managers how to initiate reorganization plans, integrate a companywide service mentality, accommodate the turmoil associated with change, and respond to competition Finally, an indispensable source for anyone - from mid-level managers through top-level executives - who needs to implement business decisions on time and within budget. In today's ever-fluctuating world, it's not enough to recognize that you and the way you do business need to change. You must know how to make changes quickly, effectively, economically, and with as little political fallout as possible, or you are bound to fail. Everywhere today you hear the concern of those trying to adapt to the rapid flux created by an uncertain economy, ever-changing market demands, and the threat of international competition. Businesses worry that they can't keep up, and every day another corporation falls prey to the myth that the status quo still works. Daryl Conner, president and founder of the consulting firm Organizational Development Resources, Inc. (ODR), is the world's number one expert on change management. ODR, Inc., has served as ""change doctor"" for clients such as Georgia Pacific, Honeywell, IBM, Levi Strauss, Mobil Oil, AT&T, Chase Manhattan, JCPenney, Pepsi-Cola Company, and numerous organizations and governments in Europe, Latin America, Asia, Australia, South Africa, and the former Soviet Union. Conner has taken his twenty years of change management experience and written a ground-breaking guide on resilient, successful change. His system focuses on how to change rather than what to change. Business people at all levels now face the major challenge of initiating company-wide reorganization plans, responding quickly to competition, establishing new products and markets, and adapting themselves smoothly to fluctuations in the economy. Conner's uniquely successful methods will teachtoday's managers to negotiate these transitions by teaching them what distinguishes resilient people from those who suffer future shock; why major change is difficult to assimilate; the key elements and the flow of events involved in human transition; what roles are central to change in organizational settings; how and why resistance forms; how people become committed to change; why organizational culture is so important to a change's success, and why powerful teamwork is at the heart of achieving change objectives. In this roller-coaster business climate, the adage ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" doesn't work anymore. Pepsi-Cola and the rest of Daryl Conner's clients will attest to that. Don't be daunted - start Managing at the Speed of Change and meet today's challenges with confidence."

The subject is astrology, which in Ptolemy's time as down to the Renaissance was fused as a respectable science with astronomy.

While still young he composed his extant epic poem of four books on the story of the Argonauts. When this work failed to win acceptance he went to Rhodes where he not only did well as a rhetorician but also made a success of his epic in a revised form, for which the Rhodians gave him the 'freedom' of their city; hence his surname. On returning to Alexandria he recited his poem again, to applause. In 196 Ptolemy Epiphanes made him the librarian of the Museum (the university) at Alexandria.<P> Apollonius's ""Argonautica"" is one of the better minor epics, remarkable for originality, powers of observation, sincere feeling, and depiction of romantic love. His Jason and Medea are natural and interesting, and did much to inspire Virgil (in a very different setting) in the fourth book of the ""Aeneid,"""

The work for this book was generated in order to focus on studies of the acquisition and impact of literacy on traditional assertions of linguistic analysts. The contributors show that claims regarding descriptions of the linguistic competence of native speakers contain phonemic, morphemic, and sentential constructs applicable only to literate language users. They also suggest that syntactic formalities -- elements lacking extensional reference -- are unlikely in the absence of literacy, and that the notions of ""sentencehood"" and syntactic well-formedness are functions of literacy. Finally, the book reviews the basic notions of literary relativity and the role of literacy in communication and civilization.<BR>"

Drawing on a wealth of data, he asserts that the losers in the struggle actually represented Christianity in its more authentic, original form. Since Orthodoxy has been defined by the victors in this struggle, it is the silenced alternative views that have been labeled ""heretical"". Ludemann's findings are important as well as liberating for understanding both Christianity and the Bible.

Young author, Lauren Urey takes the reader for an adventurous, fast-paced ride while elevating the moral and biblical principles upon which our nation was founded.

McDonough offers a popular explanation of the meaning of the Trinity--the fundamental doctrine of the Catholic faith--and its relation to the body of Christian revelation.

McDonough relies on the theology of Saints John and Paul, the teachings of the Fathers of the church, and the spiritual writings of Sister Elizabeth of the Trinity, a contemporary of Saint Therese of Lisieux.

He soon finds himself caught up in the two tales of passion and intrigue that his Franciscan guide, a refugee like himself, relates. One is the story of Enzo Strecci, a Renaissance poet from Lombardy who has the ill fortune of falling in love with the wife of Francesco Mardi, his host and protector during a time of Hapsburg incursions and espionage. The other is the story of the Franciscan's own ill-fated passion for the local Communist police commander's daughter during Tito's rupture with Stalinism. Between Rimini, Italy, in 1535 and the Croatian island of Rab in 1948, lives and fates become intertwined, history repeats itself, and nostalgia for home proves itself to be bittersweet.<BR>"

This book examines the historical and social events that enabled autism to be identified as a distinct disorder in the early twentieth century. <P>The author, herself the mother of an autistic child, argues that although there is without doubt a biogenetic component to the condition, it is the social factors involved in its identification, interpretation and remediation that determine what it means to be autistic.

Jimenez was a prolific writer - his collected verse fills twenty volumes - and his early poems were first published whilst still in his teens. During the early twentieth century Jimenez wrote and published voraciously and was very active within Spanish-speaking literary circles. In 1939, he left Spain for America, eventually settling in Puerto Rica until his death in 1958. It is difficult to hang a label on Jimenez' work, for his influences were many and his output vast. These selected poems, published here in English and the original Spanish, give the reader a chance to explore this remarkable talent."

Halsman would ask Fernandel questions about America to which he would respond using only facial expressions. With his wide, lovable horse-face, Fernandel mimicked the answers to such questions as ?Does the average Frenchman still pinch pretty girls in a crowd (silly grin) and ?What was your reaction to the great American game of baseball (perplexed). Fernandel's reactions are laugh-out-loud funny, and the book that resulted from this unusual collaboration is nothing short of wonderful.

But when abstract concepts are introduced, students often hit a brick wall.

Since they are fundamental to the study of linear algebra, students' understanding of these concepts is vital to their mastery of the subject.

As a result, political science has been ill-equipped to offer insights on the impact of legislative term limits. Term Limits and Legislative Representation tests the central arguments made by both supporters and opponents of such reform by examining the experience of Costa Rica, the only long-term democracy to impose term limits on legislators, and by providing extensive comparisons with legislatures in Venezuela and the United States. Professor Carey challenges claims made about the effects of term limits on political careers, pork barrel politics, and the effectiveness of political parties in passing their programs."

These are telescopes built by amateur and professional astronomers to suit some special need. There is, for instance, an inflatable telescope and one with a liquid mirror. Every so often a neglected design comes back into fashion: the largest telescopes now under construction use the alt-azimuth design that was ignored for over a century, and liquid mirror telescopes can be used for zenithal astronomy. The author shows why a particular engineering approach makes each telescope unique and explains the rationale behind the design. The effects on telescope performance are discussed where possible. This is not just a collection of weird and wonderful devices that proved to be false starts; the author also discusses the first instrument to measure star diameters and the first useful radio telescope. This book is a resource and stimulus for anyone who likes to build astronomical telescopes or is interested in the history of telescope-making."

The second, revised edition of this intriguing book expands and updates the text to take account of new work on the subject. It provides a valuable and accessible introduction to a range of paradoxes and their possible solutions, with questions designed to engage the reader with the arguments and full bibliographical references to both classic and current literature on the topic."

The present volume has been compiled from notes taken down at the time by three of the students: Rush Rhees, Yorick Smythies, and James Taylor. They have been supplemented by notes of conversations on Freud (to whom reference was made in the course on aesthetics) between Wittgenstein and Rush Rhees, and by notes of some lectures on religious belief. As very little is known of Wittgenstein's views on these subjects from his published works, these notes should be of considerable interest to students of contemporary philosophy. Further, their fresh and informal style should recommend Wittgenstein to those who find his ""Tractatus"" and ""Philosophical Investigations"" a little formidable."

Although modern Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) systems could provide significant support, APS implementation numbers in these industries remain low. Therefore, based on an in-depth analysis of three sample fresh food industries (dairy, fresh and processed meat), the author evaluates what APS systems should offer in order to effectively support production planning and how the leading systems currently handle the most distinguishing characteristic of fresh food industries, the short product shelf life. Starting from the identified weaknesses, customized software solutions for each of the sample industries are proposed that allow to optimize the production of fresh foods with respect to shelf life. The book thereby offers valuable insights not only to researchers but also to software providers of APS systems and professionals from fresh food industries."

Currently, no therapies are aimed at the underlying mechanisms that enable this progression due to only nascent recognition of the distinct biology which occurs only during tumor dissemination. Recent advances have highlighted the central role of cell motility during the dynamic and transient process of tumor invasion and metastasis. This book includes state-of-the-art updates by international leaders in these studies. Chapters first present the novel model systems that enable new investigations and insights. Chapters then describe in depth the key processes and molecules that may be therapeutically targeted. Finally, the role of cell motility and its signals is explored in a number of key tumor types. This compilation should be useful to researchers in basic and translational oncology as well as those developing novel agents to prevent tumor invasion and metastasis."

The sept dominated this area for much of the late medieval period following the displacement of an Anglo-Norman presence in the upper end of Bantry Bay in the thirteenth century. This was a Gaelic maritime lordship with an economic focus on fishery resources and trade and communications with continental fishing fleets.

Towards the end of the 16th century, British plantations herald the end of Gaelic dominance in the area. New settlements, industry and forms of land management radically alter the cultural character of the landscape and mark the advent of early capitalism and formalised globalization in this area.

And you'll learn to easily gather the full range of available competitive data and organize it in a manner that reveals profitable strategic insights into your competitor's bidding behavior.

It describes a cosmological model based on fuzzy spacetime that has correctly predicted a dark-energy-driven acceleration of our expanding universe - with a small cosmological constant - at a time when the popular belief was quite the contrary. It describes how the Universe is made up of an underpinning of Planck oscillators in a Quantum Vacuum. This leads to, amongst other things, a characterization of gravitation as being distributional over the entire Universe, thereby providing an answer to a puzzle brought to light by Weinberg years ago and since overlooked. There is also a simple formula for the mass spectrum of all known elementary particles, based on QCD dynamics. Many other interesting ramifications and experimental tests for the future are also discussed. This apart, there is a brief survey of some of the existing theories. The book is accessible to junior and senior researchers in High Energy Physics and Cosmology as well as the serious graduate student in Physics."

Now that information is cheap and immediately available, it is the lifeblood of every organization, and using Morris&#146; powerful new &quot; recognition and response&quot; model, you can transform your corporation into a dynamic, interactive team that anticipates every twist and turn of the market.

The Greeks not only spoke of time unfolding in a specific space, but also projected the past upon the future in order to make it active in the social practice of the present. Hesiod's history of humanity was intended to establish justice in the modern city; Bacchylides sang the celebration of the Athenian hero Theseus in a present-day cultic and ideological framework; the city of Cyrene used the heroic act of its founding to reaffirm its civic identity; and the Greeks embossed poetic texts on leaves of gold to ensure the ritual passage of the dead to a blessed afterlife. Explicating these examples, ""Poetic and Performative Memory in Ancient Greece"" shows how the Ancient Greeks' collective memory was based on a remarkable faculty for the creation of ritual and narrative symbols."

Because Martin Luther, leader of the Protestant Reformation, disliked the book of James for its emphasis on good deeds, the book has come to be viewed in opposition to Paul's letters, which emphasize faith in God. To correct these and other misperceptions about James, Scripture scholar Luke Timothy Johnson embarks on a thorough history of the interpretation of this pivotal letter, which highlights the vast appreciation for James over the centuries. With respect to the question of who wrote the letter of James, Johnson boldly identifies the writer as none other than James, the brother of Jesus Christ. While modern skepticism casts doubt on this conclusion, early textual witnesses, as well as saints and scholars throughout the centuries, corroborate Johnson's position. A thorough examination of the original language texts and an explanation of the literary context of James helps illuminate the original meaning of the letter. In addition, Johnson offers the general reader insights into the letter's relevance for today."

So what happens when we become ill, or depressed, or bankrupt? Did we do something wrong? Has God abandoned us?As a child, Michael Horton would run up the down escalator, trying to beat it to the top. As Christians, he notes, we sometimes seek God the same way, believing we can climb to him under our own steam. But we can't, which is why we are blessed that Jesus descends to us, especially during times of trial.In Too Good to Be True, Horton exposes the pop culture that sells Jesus like a product for health and happiness and reminds us that our lives often lead us on difficult routes we must follow by faith. This book offers a series of powerful readings that demonstrate how, through every type of earthly difficulty, our Father keeps his promises from Scripture and works all things together for our good."

The central figure is Anita Harris, an internationally celebrated geologist who went into her profession to get out of a Brooklyn ghetto. The unifying theme is plate tectonics-- here concentrating on the acceptance that all aspects of the theory do not universally enjoy. As such, In Suspect Terrain is a report from the rough spots at the front edge of a science. In Suspect Terrain is the second book in a series on geology and geologists, presenting a cross section of North America along the fortieth parallel, and gathered under the overall title Annals of the Former World. The other books in the series are Basin and Range, Rising from the Plains, and Assembling California. A study of the work of Anita Harris and the geological history of the Appalachian region points out questions about the theory of plate tectonics and examines evidence of continental glaciation"

Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley is the first biography to go past that myth and present an Elvis beyond the legend. Based on hundreds of interviews and nearly a decade of research, it traces the evolution not just of the man but of the music and of the culture he left utterly transformed, creating a completely fresh portrait of Elvis and his world. This volume tracks the first twenty-four years of Elvis' life, covering his childhood, the stunning first recordings at Sun Records (""That's All Right"", ""Mystery Train""), and the early RCA hits (""Heartbreak Hotel"", ""Hound Dog"", ""Don't Be Cruel""). These were the years of his improbable self-invention and unprecedented triumphs, when it seemed that everything that Elvis tried succeeded wildly. There was scarcely a cloud in sight through this period until, in 1958, he was drafted into the army and his mother died shortly thereafter. The book closes on that somber and poignant note. Last Train to Memphis takes us deep inside Elvis' life, exploring his lifelong passion for music of every sort (from blues and gospel to Bing Crosby and Mario Lanza), his compelling affection for his family, and his intimate relationships with girlfriends, mentors, band members, professional associates, and friends. It shows us the loneliness, the trustfulness, the voracious appetite for experience, and above all the unshakable, almost mystical faith that Elvis had in himself and his music. Drawing frequently on Elvis' own words and on the recollections of those closest to him, the book offers anemotional, complex portrait of young Elvis Presley with a depth and dimension that for the first time allow his extraordinary accomplishments to ring true."

S. Forester's death, Hornblower During the Crisis delivers a full measure of action at sea-the hallmark of this incomparably exciting series of historical adventures. On the threshold of securing his first post as captain, Hornblower finds himself forced by the exigencies of war to fight alongside a man whom he has unintentionally helped to court-martial. And for the first time Hornblower assents to engaging in espionage in his efforts to bring victory and glory to England in the Napoleonic Wars. This extant fragment of Forester's final Hornblower novel is followed by the author's notes regarding the novel's conclusion. Also included in this volume are two stories-""Hornblower's Temptation"" and ""The Last Encounter""-that depict the great sea dog Hornblower in his youth and old age, respectively."

1768,"Literary Couplings: Writing Couples, Collaborators, and the Construction of Authorship","Stone, Marjorie",1,Hardcover,University of Wisconsin Press,9780299217600,2006,06,01,373,,ENG,"<P>This innovative collection challenges the traditional focus on solitary genius by examining the rich diversity of literary couplings and collaborations from the early modern to the postmodern period. Literary Couplings explores some of the best-known literary partnerships--from the Sidneys to Boswell and Johnson to Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes--and also includes lesser-known collaborators such as Daphne Marlatt and Betsy Warland. The essays place famous authors such as Samuel Coleridge, Oscar Wilde, and William Butler Yeats in new contexts; reassess overlooked members of writing partnerships; and throw new light on texts that have been marginalized due to their collaborative nature. By integrating historical studies with authorship theory, ""Literary Couplings"" goes beyond static notions of the writing ""couple"" to explore literary couplings created by readers, critics, historians, and publishers as well as by writers themselves, thus expanding our understanding of authorship."

Characteristically, much of his early poetry that which was written prior to 1910, is poetry that belongs to courtship. <BR>When Yeats was twenty-three years old, he met and fell in love with the beautiful Irish nationalist, Maud Gonne.

Moreover, since South America makes a transect across most climatic belts of an entire hemisphere, it provides a unique opportunity to examine the impact of changing Quaternary climates on a variety of environments. It also forms the basis for judging the synchrony or non-synchrony of Quaternary climatic changes between hemispheres and this has important implications for climatic modelling.<P>As South America has a dynamic tectonic regime along its western margin, 3 chapters discuss the geomorphological impact of Quaternary tectonics and volcanism. The following 6 chapters integrate evidence for Quaternary changes in the great alluvial basins of the Continent Orinoco, Amazon, Parana) and in the contiguous highland massifs (Guyana, Brazil, Patagonia). As parts of the Andes have been high enough to support glaciers since the late Miocene, 5 chapters review the nature and consequences of Quaternary glacier fluctuations. The following 4 chapters select major process-form systems that impacted the continent during the Quaternary, including geocryogenic activity, palaeolake development, palaeo-gravel formations and coastal changes. Three chapters provide the first major review of Quaternary vegetation changes in South America (primarily the Andes) deduced from palaeoecological data. The final chapter weaves most of the environmental threads together in an overall synthesis of the Quaternary of South America.<P>The book is lavishly illustrated with photographs and line diagrams. As it provides a compendium of data and analyses about Quaternary changes for a wholecontinent, this book should appeal to a wide range of environmental disciplines."

Norman Roth traces the chain of events that led to mass conversions of Spanish Jews to Christianity in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the rise of animosity against them, the establishment of the Inquisition, and finally, the 1492 Expulsion of the Jews from Spain. Citing evidence from his extensive research of medieval documents, he firmly refutes the traditionally accepted story of ""crypto-Judaism"", which contends that the conversos were forced publicly to abandon their faith, while continuing secretly to maintain their Jewish traditions. Roth argues persuasively that the conversos were, in fact, sincere Christians."

Avoiding preconceptions about ancient sexuality, he explores the ethics of desire and marriage and pays careful attention to the original meanings of words, especially those used as evidence of Paul's opposition to homosexuality. For example, after a remarkably faithful reading of the scriptural texts, Martin concludes that our contemporary obsession with marriage--and the whole search for the ""right"" sexual relationships--is antithetical to the message of the gospel. In all of these essays, however, Martin argues for engaging Scripture in a way that goes beyond the standard historical-critical questions and the assumptions of textual agency in order to find a faith that has no foundations other than Jesus Christ."

2032,The Writings of Carlos Fuentes,"Williams, Raymond Leslie",1,Hardcover,Univ of Texas Pr,9780292790971,1996,01,01,185,,ENG,"Smitten by the modernity of Cervantes and Borges at an early age, Carlos Fuentes has written extensively on the cultures of the Americas and on those elsewhere in the world. His work includes over a dozen novels, among them the Death of Artemio Cruz, Christopher Unborn, The Old Gringo, and Terra Nostra, several volumes of short stories, numerous essays on literary, cultural, and political topics, and some theater. In this book, Raymond Leslie Williams traces the themes of history, culture, and identity in Fuentes' work, particularly in his complex, major novel Terra Nostra. He opens with a biography of Fuentes that links his works to his intellectual life, a life that has been centrally concerned with finding and defining the source and character of Latin American culture. The heart of the study is Williams' extensive reading of the novel Terra Nostra, in which Fuentes explores the presence of Spanish culture and history in Latin America. Williams concludes with a look at how Fuentes' other fiction relates to Terra Nostra, including Fuentes' own division of his work into fourteen cycles that he calls ""La Edad del Tiempo"", and with an interview in which Fuentes discusses his concept of this cyclical division. Williams' analysis maps a terrain often left unexplored - the ""Spanishness"" of Latin American culture - and offers the most in-depth study currently available on Latin America's most prolific living novelist. It will be vital reading for all students of Latin American literature."
2033,High Concept: Movies and Marketing in Hollywood,"Wyatt, Justin",1,Paperback,Univ of Texas Pr,9780292790919,1994,01,01,237,,ENG,"Steven Spielberg once said, ""I like ideas, especially movie ideas, that you can hold in your hand. If a person can tell me the idea in twenty-five words or less, it's going to make a pretty good movie."" Spielberg's comment embodies the essence of the high concept film, which can be condensed into one simple sentence that inspires marketing campaigns, lures audiences, and separates success from failure at the box office. This pioneering study explores the development and dominance of the high concept movie within commercial Hollywood filmmaking since the late 1970s. Justin Wyatt describes how box office success, always important in Hollywood, became paramount in the era in which major film studios passed into the hands of media conglomerates concerned more with the economics of filmmaking than aesthetics. In particular, he shows how high concept films became fully integrated with their marketing, so that a single phrase (""Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water . . ."") could sell the movie to studio executives and provide copy for massive advertising campaigns; a single image or a theme song could instantly remind potential audience members of the movie, and tie-in merchandise could generate millions of dollars in additional income."

Most Roman myths do not consist of stories about the gods and their actions, nor were they presented as fictional, magic stories. Ancient writers such as Livy, Virgil, and Ovid treated myths as history: the history of Rome itself, of its rituals and religious practices, and of important, noble Roman families.

Marx's attacks on Stirner, Proudhon, and Bakunin are shown to be of vital importance to the understanding not only of the subsequent enmity between Marxists and anarchists, but also of Marx's own interpretation of revolutionary politics. <BR> Paul Thomas argues that the continuity in Marx's successive attacks on anarchism a continuity which, he believes, has a distinctively Hegelian lineage tells us much about the unity of Marx's thought as a whole. In addition, he contends that tracing this continuity helps to re-situate Marx's thought in the context of the nineteenth century, when Marxism was not an unchallenged orthodoxy but a doctrine and method that needed to be defended against rival revolutionary impulses."

2077,Casting Kings: Bards and Indian Modernity,"Snodgrass, Jeffrey G.",1,Paperback,Oxford Univ Pr,9780195307757,2006,07,01,226,,ENG,"Based on three years of anthropological fieldwork in the Indian state of Rajasthan, Casting Kings explores the manner in which semi-nomadic performers known as Bhats understand, and also subvert, caste hierarchies. A number of scholars have recently contended that caste is invented and thus a fiction of a kind. But focus in these studies is typically placed on the way caste is imagined according to the agendas and desires of elite Westerners such as colonial officials. In this book, by contrast, the author argues that Bhats themselves understand the imaginative dimensions of caste relations. Indeed, such insights are shown to lie at the heart of the Bhats traditional profession of praise- and insult-singing. Likewise, the author demonstrates how the ability to cleverly rework and even sabotage lingering caste inequalities continues to form the basis for Bhat claims to status and dignity in contemporary India."

In presenting his case Taylor engages with many key works of contemporary metaphysics, semantics, and philosophical logic, so his book will be of interest to a broad spectrum of scholars and students."

Despite peace agreements between Israel and two Arab countries (Egypt and Jordan) in the 1990s and a partial settlement with the Palestinian authorities in 1993, violence reached its highest level in 2002-2004, and has still not abated. The withdrawal of Israeli forces and settlers from occupied Gaza is a step in the right direction, but too many uncertainties remain. Author Lars Blinkenberg was Denmark's ambassador to three of the involved countries in the late 1990sSyria, Jordan, and Lebanon. After his retirement in 2000, he returned to the area numerous times to write this book on the conflict, beginning with its background in the 1948 war.

It will appeal to students and scholars of international relations, international law, and political economy, as well as those with a special interest in the politics of knowledge, postcolonial critique, international and regional historiography, and comparative politics."

This thread is Russell's doctrine that logic is an absolutely general science and that any calculus for it must embrace wholly unrestricted variables. The heart of Landini's book is a careful analysis of Russell's largely unpublished ""substitutional"" theory. On Landini's showing, the substitutional theory reveals the unity of Russell's philosophy of logic and offers new avenues for a genuine solution of the paradoxes plaguing Logicism."

The most recent enlargement and proposed legal reforms reflect a commitment to democracy: stabilizing political life for citizens governed by new regimes, and constructing a European Union more accountable to civil society. Despite the perceived novelty of these reforms, this book explains (through quantitative data and qualitative case analyses) how the European Court of Justice has developed and sustained a vibrant tradition of democratic constitutionalism since the 1960s. The book documents the dramatic consequences of this institutional change for civil society and public policy reform throughout Europe. Cichowski offers detailed empirical and historical studies of gender equality and environmental protection law across fifteen countries and over thirty years, revealing important linkages between civil society, courts and the construction of governance. The findings bring into question dominant understandings of legal integration."

Nature speaks to her, and she speaks to nature (""I put my face close to the lily, where it stands just above the grass, and give it a good greeting from the stem of my heart""). Says Mary Oliver, ""This book is biased, opinionated; also it is joyful, and probably there's despair here too - can a life slide forward sixty years without it?

A discussion of dating evidence leads to alternative dates being offered for some of the camps. To aid interpreting the sites, army organisation and art of encampment for the period of the Numantine Wars is discussed. This study gives added importance to the sites at Numantia, for they not only form the main source of archaeological evidence for Late Republican camps, but provide evidence for the form of camp for both the late manipular army and the early cohort one."

A principal argument of these foundations is that artworks are maximal memory stores. The theory of geometry is developed from Leyton's fundamental laws of memory storage, and this book shows that these laws determine the structure of paintings. Furthermore, the book demonstrates that the emotion expressed by a painting is actually the memory extracted by the laws. Therefore, the laws of memory storage allow the systematic and rigorous mapping not only of the compositional structure of a painting, but also of its emotional expression. The argument is supported by detailed analyses of paintings by Picasso, Raphael, Cezanne, Gauguin, Modigliani, Ingres, De Kooning, Memling, Balthus and Holbein."

In this incisive new book, the man that has been called--the only one to understand the mind of the jihadist--shows that the most important battle is actually taking place in the hearts and minds of the world's population. This is the war of ideas, where ideology is the most powerful weapon of all. Phares explores the beliefs of two opposing camps, one standing for democracy and human rights, and the other rejecting the idea of an international community and calling for jihad against the West. He reveals the strategies of both sides, explaining that new technologies and the growing media savvy of the jihadists have raised the stakes in the conflict. And most urgently, he warns that the West is in danger of losing the war, for whereas debate and theorizing rarely translate into action here, ideas and deeds are inextricably linked for the forces of jihad."

The thought that kept running through my mind was what would it take for a woman to open her eyes. In the book there are numerous topics that are based on true stories that most women can relate to or know of someone who have experienced similar situations in their lives. In the chapters I talk about women in denial, having low self esteem, enduring mental and verbal abuse, domestic violence, and sex. In addition, signs of men who live on the down low.

From this standpoint I will review some of the latest research in human psychology, neuroscience, and organization in order to identify ways for computing to address the restraint of fear.Next, I share my theory and vision for computers to assist organizations to become more energized, meaning that they will have the necessary abilities to survive and to succeed. Energy in this sense is the unleashing of human and organizational potential, but it is also about using computing in revolutionary new ways; for humans and computers to work autonomously and in some cases ""bend time."" Finally, I take the energized organization and add the strategic mind on top of it. The mind in this case is a combined human and computer effort; it is up to the leaders and managers to exploit computing to its very limits and to its full potential."

In Ecoagriculture, two of the world's leading experts on conservation and development examine the idea that agricultural landscapes can be designed more creatively to take the needs of human populations into account while also protecting, or even enhancing, biodiversity. They present a thorough overview of the innovative concept of ""ecoagriculture""--the management of landscapes for both the production of food and the conservation of wild biodiversity. The book: examines the global impact of agriculture on wild biodiversitydescribes the challenge of reconciling biodiversity conservation and agricultural goalsoutlines and discusses the ecoagriculture approachpresents diverse case studies that illustrate key strategiesexplores how policies, markets, and institutions can be re-shaped to support ecoagriculture<P>While focusing on tropical regions of the developing world--where increased agricultural productivity is most vital for food security, poverty reduction, and sustainable development, and where so much of the world's wild biodiversity is threatened--it also draws on lessons learned in developed countries. Dozens of examples from around the world present proven strategies for small-scale, low-income farmers involved in commercial production.<P>Ecoagriculture explores new approaches to agricultural production that complement natural environments, enhance ecosystem function, and improve rural livelihoods. It features a wealth of real-world case studies that demonstrate the applicability ofthe ideas discussed and how the principles can be applied, and is an important new work for policymakers, students, researchers, and anyone concerned with conserving biodiversity while sustaining human populations."
3565,Rat,"Zaniewski, Andrej",1,Hardcover,Little Brown & Co,9781559702621,1994,09,01,176,,ENG,"A graphic description of the life of a rat journeying through a world controlled by modern human civilization and its struggles for survival becomes a metaphor about society and its laws, myths, and truths   Not since Patrick Suskind's best-seller Perfume a half dozen years ago has a work of fiction from abroad created such prepublication excitement. Published simultaneously in nine countries around the world, Andrzej Zaniewski's novel Rat takes as its protagonist one of the most feared and maligned creatures on the planet. Rattus norvegicus and Rattus rattus - the ""domestic"" rat and the gray rat, the two basic species of the great rat familyhave accompanied humankind since the beginning of its existence. Throughout history people have created conditions favorable for rats and enabled the species to survive and prosper. In Rat, the author has undertaken the formidable task of describing the world from that animal's viewpoint. In a place of darkness and mystery, a rat takes us from his first moments of consciousness to his final breath. With uncanny ability, the author manages to lead the reader into the mind and universe of his protagonist, to transform one of nature's most despised animals into a poignant creature representative of us all. In the gutters, drains, and sewers in which the rat lives, we may identify our own world. In the rat's pain, our pain. In its fear, our fear and despair. And in its restless wanderings, with daily survival an uncertainty, our own fate. Rat is a powerful allegory about the laws that govern us all, about our mythologies, truths and lies, love and hope, loneliness and longing. Humans and rats belong to the same cosmos. Like it or not, we are near relatives, biologically and psychologically. ""Don't think that you love and fail, win and lose, or live and die differently from a rat"", warns the author. ""A rat has created this novel, but you will find yourselfin it""."

And it is an effective counterweight to the prevailing conservative view that irony is the first step towards cynicism and the breakdown of Western culture."

Three native sons of Homer---a detective, a journalist, and a painter---helped to inscribe Abraham Lincoln's place in the nation's iconic imagery. Private investigator Eli DeVoe foiled an assassination plot against Lincoln before his first inauguration, journalist William Osborn Stoddard rose from an early booster of Lincoln's political career to become an influential secretary of the president, and artist Francis Bicknell Carpenter painted The First Reading of the Emancipation Proclamation before the Cabinet, the renowned painting that still hangs in the U.S. Capitol. This exploration of these men and the town that produced them offers insight into the complexities of presidential image-making and reveals why the Lincoln Forum Bulletin has named Homer ""a new Lincoln mecca.""]"

After more than a decade of military operations across Central Asia and the Middle East, the Al Qaida leader who orchestrated the 9/11 terrorist attacks was finally killed in a firefight with U.S. Navy SEALs in Pakistan. Although this daring raid marked the end of the longest strategic manhunt in American history, bin Laden was not the first individual targeted as the objective of a military campaign.

But theologians have for millenia differed among themselves as to the interpretation of this symbol. Political ramifications of, or reactions to, this Judaeo-Christian idea have included the Holy Roman Empire, the Crusades, the Third Rome', American Manifest Destiny, Zionism, the Third Reich, and Liberation Theology. This book focuses on the question of whether the kingdom of God is necessarily related to certain political implications, and its possible implications for democracy and democratic theory.

Better than TCP for carrying voice across the Internet!<P>-- In-depth coverage: goals, design, features, and applications -- including voice and general purpose applications.<P>-- CD-ROM contains 2 complete reference implementations, including an actual kernel implementation for Linux.<P>SCTP is rapidly being accepted as the ideal solution for carrying voice across the Internet -- and a powerful improvement on TCP for a wide range of general purpose applications. In this authoritative reference and implementer's guide, the protocol's creators take you inside SCTP, present its goals and key aspects of its design, and introduce today's best techniques for leveraging it in diverse IP-based applications. Randall Stewart and Qiaobing Yie demonstrate how SCTP enhances TCP, how it addresses serious security and reliability weaknesses in the existing Internet transport architecture, and how it has evolved through the IETF standards process. Next, they show how to take full advantage of SCTP's power to make IP-based communications more reliable and robust -- and to meet the challenges of tomorrow's most business-critical Internet applications. The accompanying CD-ROM contains two complete reference implementations: a generic daemon process that can support non-SCTP kernels, and an actual kernel implementation for Linux. For all network and telecommunication programmers, system designers, and architects."

But Asclepiades of Bithynia did far more than reform much of traditional Hippocratic therapeutic practice; he devised an extraordinary physical theory which he used to explain all biological phenomena in uniformly simple terms. His work laid the theoretical basis for the antitheoretical medical sect called Methodism. Though none of this work survives, Asclepiades was the subject of numerous ancient testimonia, from which this book attempts to reconstruct many details of his theory. His ideas offer a fascinating glimpse into the ways in which Hellenistic philosophy and medicine interacted, and provide an introduction to one of the most intriguing doctrinal disputes in Greek science."

Starting on the eve of the French Revolution in the late 1780s, Durschmied not only describes the dramatic events but enriches each of these historic upheavals by quoting the protagonists on both sides. Letting facts and quotations speak for themselves, he sets forth and analyzes the French, Mexican, and Russian revolutions, the failed ""putsch"" against Hitler in 1944, the Cuban Revolution, and finally the Iranian Revolution that ousted the Shah in 1979. Each revolution has its own dynamic and fascinating cast of characters, but all too often, as this wonderfully researched work shows, the end result is the same: mayhem, betrayal, and death."

It improves readers' civic literacy, and will start them on a lifelong journey in developing the concepts, skills, and behaviors that will make political and governmental institutions more responsive to their needs, interests and expectations. Chapter topics cover the social and economic milieu of Texas politics; the Texas constitution; intergovernmental relationships; interest groups and power in Texas politics; the mass media; the party system; elections, campaigns, and political behavior; the Texas legislature; the Texas executive; bureaucracy and policy implementation; the judicial system; local government; and contemporary public policy issues in Texas. For anyone who wants a better understanding of the legislative theory and actual practice of state politics and government--especially the citizens of Texas."

5224,The Mammoth Hunters,"Auel, Jean M.",1,Hardcover,Random House Inc,9780609610992,2001,11,01,645,,ENG,"Ayla, the independent heroine of The Clan of the Cave Bear and The Valley of Horses, sets out from the valley on Whinney, the horse she tamed. With her is Jondalar, the tall, handsome, yellow-haired man she nursed back to health and came to love. Together they meet the Mamutoi--the Mammoth Hunters--people like Ayla. But to Ayla, who was raised by the Clan of the Cave Bear, they are ""the Others."" She approaches them with mixed feelings of fear and curiosity. <BR>Talut, a powerful bear of a man with bright red hair, a booming laugh, and a gentle heart, and his tall, dark-haired sister, Tulie, are the leaders of the Lion Camp of the Mamutoi. It is here that Ayla finds her first women friends, but some among the Mamutoi dislike Ayla because she was raised by ""flatheads,"" their name for the people of the Clan. Ayla is haunted by her memories of the Clan because Rydag, a child of mixed parentage living with the Mamutoi, bears so strong a resemblance to her own son, Durc. <BR>It is the Mamutoi master carver of ivory--dark-skinned Ranec, flirtatious, artistic, magnetic--who fascinates Ayla. She finds herself drawn to him. Because of her uncanny control over animals, her healing skills, and the magic firestone she discovered, Ayla is adopted into the Mammoth Hearth by Mamut, the ancient shaman of the Great Earth Mother. <BR>Ayla finds herself torn between her strong feelings for Ranec and her powerful love for the wildly jealous and unsure Jondalar. It is not until after the great mammoth hunt, when Ayla's life is threatened, that a fateful decision is made. <BR>Set in the challenging terrain of Ice Age Europe that millions of Jean Auel's readers have come to treasure, The Mammoth Hunters is anepic novel of love, knowledge, jealousy, and hard choices--a novel certain to garner Jean Auel even greater acclaim as a master storyteller of the dawn of humanity. Ayla and Jondalar embark on a journey that takes them to the Mamutoi, the Mammoth Hunters, and Ayla must make a fateful choice between two men--Jondalar and Ranec, the Mamutoi's master carver, in a story of Ice Age Europe."

Forester's fictional hero Horatio Hornblower began to delight readers, there has been speculation as to whether his adventures were based on the career of a real naval officer. Several names were suggested, but the general conclusion was that Hornblower was a composite character. However, while researching the campaign that resulted in the burning of Washington's public buildings, Bryan Perrett consulted Forester's Naval War of 1812 and was surprised to discover that the author had been deliberately reticent regarding a Captain James Alexander Gordon, RN, who had led his squadron up the Potomac. Further inspection of naval records revealed a startling number of parallels between the careers of Gordon and Hornblower. It became apparent that, while Forester certainly included other historical episodes in the Hornblower cycle, he was aware of Gordon when the first of the books was written, and that when he decided to expand the series he chose Gordon's career as the framework on which his hero's life would be based. In telling the largely unknown story of Admiral Gordon's active service career, Bryan Perrett has produced a book that will be appreciated by the thousands of readers who have enjoyed the adventures of Horatio Hornblower and his successors. It will also be welcomed by anyone with an interest in the naval warfare of the Napoleonic period, while those who take pleasure in biography will find that they have the added bonus of an absorbing literary and historical detective story."

It deals with the internal and external issues such as the tendency toward a bifurcated mentality and practice such as the 'this is business' syndrome as well as the social issue of race and affirmative action. Ministers and laity in the black church must actively engage themselves in overcoming the inequities that are still endemic to life in urban America. Harris affirms that affirmative action policies are more important than ever in obtaining a degree of social justice.

E. M. Halliday's absorbing and lucid portrait recognizes these and other puzzles about this great founder, but shows us how understandable they can be in light of his personal and social circumstances. <P>Halliday takes readers deep into Jefferson's private life--exploring his childhood, his literary taste, and his unconventional religious thinking and moral philosophy. Here, too, are his adamant opinions on women, the evolution of his ideas on democracy and freedom of expression, and fresh insights into his relationship with Sally Hemings. An incisive exploration of Thomas Jefferson takes readers into the president's private and personal life, exploring his childhood, his literary taste, and his unconventional religious thinking and moral philosophy.

""My Life in"" The New York Times constitutes a kind of collaged media commonplace book, compiling fragments of advice, wisdom and comment, sequenced into a loose narrative based on the cycle of life, from childhood and school to career and ultimately death, with attendant themes of ambition, success, disappointment and tenacity tackled en route. Details such as scotch tape bleeding through the paper are lovingly reproduced here, projecting a charming mortality of materials amid the poignancy of the thoughts Bleckner gathers.

The Bondurant Boys were a notorious gang of roughnecks and moonshiners who ran liquor through Franklin County during Prohibition and after. The brothers played a central role in a major conspiracy trial and its violent end. In 1935, Sherwood Anderson, working on a magazine story, finds himself driving along the dusty red roads trying to find the brothers and break the silence that shrouds Franklin County. In vivid, muscular prose, Matt Bondurant brings these men--their dark deeds, their long silences, their deep desires--to life. His understanding of the passion, violence, and desperation at the center of this world is both heartbreaking and magnificent."

Few authors have spun stories of Thanatos and Eros as skillfully and powerfully as Livia Llewellyn.

An orphan girl with a mind for anthracite falls into the hands of a cult worshipping an entombed god. In the Pacific Northwest, evergreens lull prepubescent girls into their trunks to serve as wombs. A suburban housewife troubled by her present encounters the sixteen year-old girl she ached to touch in her dreams.

The question is why do three mid-career Irish poets choose to write ambitious and problematic poems about the Lough Derg experience?

In May of 1895, Monet turned capriciously, it seemed to some, to the immutable facade of a Gothic cathedral. Struck by the curious choice of a medieval monument as subject matter, critics, used to talking about ""instantaneity,"" continued to lay emphasis on the theme of temporality, and this was addressed in two distinct but related ways. First, there was the matter of perception--the temporality that is involved in engaging visually with the near impenetrable surfaces of individual canvases, suggesting the dense complexity--the nuances--of our ""momentary"" perception. Then, there was the temporality involved in the real historical character of the motif itself; an awareness of the persistence of memory embedded in the medieval edifice and its significations of history and nation. It is the critical discourse and its complex negotiations--aesthetic, philosophical, and literary--that this book examines."

Written for parents and for professionals working with children and their parents, this book demonstrates that children's social development must be given paramount importance in order for them to achieve long-term school success. Particularly in the early years a child's sense of self and his or her ability to trust the environment are the qualities that need to be nurtured more than cognitive skills. Dr. Mishne shows parents how to be effective caregivers by knowing realistically what to expect from a child based on a well-illustrated developmental timetable and an appreciation for individual differences. From supporting bids for autonomy to structuring homework assignments, she gives parents the know-how for managing challenges. She also dispels popular misconceptions about children that can impede healthy parent-child interaction and child development.

This book shows us that Late Medieval Malta was not an artistic desert, that patronage in Mdina was surprisingly well-informed, and that the Renaissance reached Malta before the coming of the Knights. Architecture, however, lagged behind, and the stylistic and technical innovations reflected the conservatism of an insular society. Through the art and architecture of that period, Professor Buhagiar outlines the Christianization and Latinization process that moved the islands away from a Muslim and North African bias, to a South European sphere of influence. The author's many years of meticulous research and academic activity have resulted in an excellently presented book that can be enjoyed by both the academic and the general reader."

She describes the thriving music scene over some sixty years, including opera, concert giving and promotion, and the struggles of individuals who pursued music as an ideal, a career, a trade, a business--or all those things at once. Smith demonstrates that music making was closely tied to broader Progressive Era issues, including political and economic developments, the new roles played by women, and issues of race, ethnicity, and class."

Did the girl fall into the water by accident? Or was she pushed? Attractive, blonde Gabriel Endicott is an apparently wealthy young widow, a newcomer to Australia's Larapinta district where everyone else seems to know the neighbors very well indeed. The next day she receives a newspaper clipping in the mail about the drowning. The clipping ends with the enigmatic statement that the police are anxious to interview a woman seen running from the bridge over the creek, ""a young, fair-haired woman wearing a white dress"". Gabriel doesn't know who would have sent her this news. Or the subsequent envelopes containing information about the death of young Carol Zamia. But she was wearing a cream-colored suit and had walked near the bridge that night. Now the police, the town, everyone, seems to suspect her of complicity in the girl's death. Either she pushed Carol or, aware of an accident, she failed to rescue her. Gabriel's efforts to free herself from suspicion only arouse more doubts as to her innocence, even in those who want most to believe in her. When Gabriel Endicott moves to Australia's Larapinta, she becomes a suspect in the drowning of a fourteen-year-old girl when a woman who fits her description was seen running away from the death site"

8152,Conscription and Conflict in the Confederacy,"Moore, Albert Burton",1,Paperback,University of South Carolina Press,9781570031526,1996,10,01,388,,ENG,"  A standard source for more than three generations of Civil War scholars, Conscription and Conflict in the Confederacy remains the authoritative study of the Confederate draft. In this landmark book, Albert Burton Moore uses conscription to illustrate a central paradox of the Confederacy: in order to protect its commitment to states' rights, the Confederacy was forced to adopt tactics of centralized government. Charting the strength of Confederate forces before and after conscription's implementation in 1862, Moore examines the system's daily operations, troublesome procedures for substitutions and exemptions, and ultimate collapse. He conveys the controversy surrounding conscription by quoting from acerbic and sometimes eloquent arguments for and against conscription put forth by governors, congressmen, newspaper editors, and soldiers. Although Moore credits Confederate conscription with a high degree of success, he blames it for causing friction between state governors and President Jefferson Davis, dissension between state and national judicial systems, and bureaucratic problems of colossal proportions. William Garrett Piston's new introduction places the volume in its historical context and underscores one of the most remarkable features of the study - Moore's forthright admission that a large number of Southerners did not support the Confederacy."

Beginning slowly with the day-to-day life of a private eye, Grafton suddenly shifts from the voice of Kinsey Millhone to that of Solana Rojas, introducing readers to a chilling sociopath. Rojas is not her birth name. It is an identity she cunningly stole, an identity that gives her access to private caregiving jobs. The true horror of the novel builds with excruciating tension as the reader foresees the awfulness that lies ahead. The suspense lies in whether Millhone will realize what is happening in time to intervene. <br><br>Though set in the late eighties, ""T is for Trespass"" could not be more topical: identity theft; elder abuse; betrayal of trust; the breakdown in the institutions charged with caring for the weak and the dependent. It reveals a terrifying but all-too-real rip in the social fabric. Once again, Grafton opens up new territory with startling results."

This dramatic account follows Stampede's blood-on-the-mat saga of more than 50 years, from its grassroots beginnings in Calgary to its rise and bitter fall.

The Hart family crumbled along with the league, with son Owen dying in the ring and other members torn apart by begrudging feuds and internal strife. Full of violence, sex, and drugs, this is a gripping tale of the birth of professional wrestling."

For it was they, the German people, the Volkish Bevolkerung who believed, and it was true, that the Versailles Treaty imposed merciless reparations upon the German people that affected them in complex ways-to annihilate their nationhood, their sovereign compacity forever to make wat. Yet while it virtually destroyed the Kaiserreich of Post WWI and, tructh to tell, said many times, set the stage for Hitler's popularity. The rise of national Socialism, the Nazi Party and WWII the Treaty shoes how mistaken and despotic revenge can be. Christian Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Col. Von Stauffenberg did not want to destroy the German people. They schemed to kill the diabolical fiend Adolph Hitler."

Freedom, he says, is the 'real bling' and its currency is priceless. The Real Bling challenges readers to insist upon strong leadership, build self confidence, and refuse to make excuses any longer for not controlling their own destiny. Using hip-hop culture as a metaphor for this new kind of freedom born from rebellion against the norm, McClellan pulls no punches. His straightforward yet dynamic style has explosive potential to motivate those who are burnt out on self-help or motivational genre reading. There are only two choices in life, says McClellan, quoting Tupac, and that is to ride or die, which means to move forward to a goal with pleasure or stagnate. And with The Real Bling, conquering the world will never be more fun."

In other words, is prayer the only way to save our world? The answer requires us to consider prayer in a completely ecumenical way. Praying For New Orleans therefore explains the process of 'structured prayer', which can be practiced by people of all faiths. The structure of prayer is illustrated through the stories of families impacted by the hurricane of 2005 that caused the flooding of New Orleans. In some respects this book is a parable that illustrates the difficult reality of praying 'Thy Will Be Done.'"

He played an important role in the process of translation, publication, and interpretation that brought ""theory"" to prominence. His texts have been especially important to the deconstructive tradition, given his early recognition of the importance of Jacques Derrida. Taught by Theodor W. Adorno, he is equally at home in the Critical Theory of the Frankfurt School, in the German literary and philosophical tradition, or in psychoanalysis. This book brings together essays by eminent scholars seeking to assess the impact of Weber's writings. It also contains two new and previously unpublished essays by Weber himself: ""'God Bless America!'"" and ""'Going Along for the Ride: Violence and Gesture-Agamben Reading Benjamin Reading Kafka Reading Cervantes.'"""

The Elgin Marbles, designed and executed by Phidias to adorn the Parthenon, are some of the most beautiful sculptures of ancient Greece. In 1801 Lord Elgin, then British ambassador to the Turkish government in Athens, had pieces of the frieze sawn off and removed to Britain, where they remain, igniting a storm of controversy which has continued to the present day. In this reissue of the first fulllength work on this fiercely debated issue, Christopher Hitchens recounts the history of these precious sculptures and forcefully makes the case for their return to Greece. Drawing Out the artistic, moral, legal and political perspectives of the argument, Hitchens's eloquent prose makes The Elgin Marbles an invaluable contribution to one of the most important cultural controversies of our times."

So went the chant at the international parade leading into the2001 summit in Genoa, Italy.

Chette Williams, full-time chaplain of the Auburn University football team, tells how God transformed his life and how God continues to use him to influence football players at Auburn and beyond. As a player in the 1980s, some of Williams' Auburn teammates said he ""wasn't worth praying for."" He was a mean, bitter, angry young man, and when Coach Pat Dye kicked him off the team, nobody was surprised. With God's help, Williams turned his life around and he vowed to help others do the same. Throughout Auburn's perfect 13?0 season in 2004, Coach Tommy Tuberville gave Williams credit for leading the team through adversity to success. ""He was the rock we held on to,"" Tuberville said.

The author Margaret Cesa takes us back to the beginnings of this remarkable woman, born in 1906 in the drab mining town of Castlegate, Utah. Pop's mother, Merea Margherete Luenberger, was from Berne, Switzerland. Her father was Joe Lujan of Taos Pueblo. She was a graduate of the famous 1937 class of the Dorothy Dunn studio at the Santa Fe Indian School. Her paintings, jewelry, textile designs and murals grace museums, private collections and public institutions across the country. During her artistic life, Pop knew some of the most influential people of her times. From the long collaboration of Pop Chalee and Margaret Cesa, we hear, in the artist's own voice, the story and burdens of being a Native American woman artist in a society that was often hostile to one or another of those terms."

8804,Partner Choice and Cooperation in Networks: Theory and Experimental Evidence,"Ule, Aljaz",1,Paperback,Springer Verlag,9783540730156,2008,02,01,202,,ENG,"<P>Cooperation is beneficial but may be hard to achieve in situations where the selfish interests of individuals conflict with their common goal, such as in sharing of goods, help, knowledge or information, in trade and pollution negotiations, and in exploitation of common resources. The standard models of such ""social dilemmas"" assume that the individuals are obliged to participate in the dilemma. These models fail to capture an important element of human interaction: that people are in general free to select their interaction partners. In this book a social dilemma with partner selection is introduced and studied with the methods of formal game theory, experimental economics and computer simulations. It allows exploration of simultaneous dynamics of the network structure and cooperative behavior on this structure. The results of this study show that partner choice strongly facilitates cooperation and leads to networks where free-riders are likely to be excluded."

Yet in bringing together these two areas of study, the nine internationally renowned scholars in this volume shed new and surprising light on women's roles as performers of dance, choreographers, shapers of aesthetic trends, and patrons of dance in Italy, France, England, and Germany before 1800.<BR> Through dance, women asserted power in spheres largely dominated by men: the court, the theater, and the church. As women's dance worlds intersected with men's, their lives and visions were supported or opposed, creating a complex politics of creative, spiritual, and political expression. From a women's religious order in the thirteenth-century Low Countries that used dance as a spiritual rite of passage to the salon culture of eighteenth-century France where dance became an integral part of women's cultural influence, the writers in this volume explore the meaning of these women's stories, performances, and dancing bodies, demonstrating that dance is truly a field across which women have moved with finesse and power for many centuries past."

In Dore Ashton's sparkling account of Teshigahara's life and work, the artist shines as a seminal figure who has vaulted boundaries between the arts in a quest for new ways to express creativity. No discussion of postwar Japanese visual or cinematic arts can be complete without him. It was perhaps inevitable that Teshigahara's life in art would be a quest for resolution: between past and present, inherited and avant-garde forms, Japanese tradition and Western innovation. As the son of the multi-talented artist and ikebana master Sofu, Teshigahara grew up with an acute consciousness of Japanese art history. Yet he reached maturity in the wake of World War II, and his artistic consciousness was forged in that crucible of intellectual and artistic energies where, with young talents like Kobo Abe and Segi Shinichi, he sought to rebuild a Japanese identity from the ashes of defeat. His first medium was film - one of the few artistic domains unexplored by his father. The young Teshigahara established his name with documentaries, historical dramas, and adaptations of Abe's novels, most notably The Woman in the Dunes. During the 1960s he was the driving force behind Tokyo's alternative performance center, Sogetsu Hall. In the 1970s he broke new ground again, establishing a pottery at Echizen, only to succeed to the head of the Sofu ikebana school upon his father's death. With typical exuberance, Teshigahara has extended ikebana art to embrace bamboo and create applications for set design and installation. Meanwhile he continues his forays into othermedia. Drawing on extensive firsthand and published sources, Dore Ashton traces the eclectic influences on Teshigahara. She clearly sets off the dynamic tensions at play in Teshigahara's work, and pays particular attention to his contemporaries - essential given the artist's collaborative spirit."

9249,The Dance of Change: The Challenges to Sustaining Momentum in a Learning Organization,"Senge, Peter M.",1,Paperback,Random House Inc,9780385493222,1999,03,01,560,,ENG,"Outlines the challenges faced by managers and executives in a changing organization, and details how to maintain a progressive business after initial changes are introduced Since Peter Senge published his groundbreaking book The Fifth Discipline, he and his associates have frequently been asked by the business community: ""How do we go beyond the first steps of corporate change? How do we sustain momentum?"" They know that companies and organizations cannot thrive today without learning to adapt their attitudes and practices. But companies that establish change initiatives discover, after initial success, that even the most promising efforts to transform or revitalize organizations--despite interest, resources, and compelling business results--can fail to sustain themselves over time. That's because organizations have complex, well-developed immune systems, aimed at preserving the status quo. <BR>Now, drawing upon new theories about leadership and the long-term success of change initiatives, and based upon twenty-five years <BR>of experience building learning organizations, the authors of The Fifth Discipline Fieldbook show how to accelerate success and avoid the obstacles that can stall momentum. The Dance of Change, written for managers and executives at every level of an organization, reveals how business leaders can work together to anticipate the challenges that profound change will ultimately force the organization to face. Then, in a down-to-earth and compellingly clear format, readers will learn how to build the personal and organizational capabilities needed to meet those challenges. <BR>These challenges are not imposed from the outside; they are the product of assumptions and practices that people take for granted--an inherent, natural part of the processes of change. And they can stop innovation cold, unless managers at all levels learn toanticipate them and recognize the hidden rewards in each challenge, and the potential to spur further growth. Within the frequently encountered challenge of ""Not Enough Time,"" for example--the lack of control over time available for innovation and learning initiatives--lies a valuable opportunity to reframe the way people organize their workplaces. <BR>This book identifies universal challenges that organizations ultimately find themselves confronting, including the challenge of ""Fear and Anxiety""; the need to diffuse learning across organizational boundaries; the ways in which assumptions built in to corporate measurement systems can handcuff learning initiatives; and the almost unavoidable misunderstandings between ""true believers"" and nonbelievers in a company. <BR>Filled with individual and team exercises, in-depth accounts of sustaining learning initiatives by managers and leaders in the field, and well-tested practical advice, The Dance of Change provides an insider's perspective on implementing learning and change initiatives at such corporations as British Petroleum, Chrysler, Dupont, Ford, General Electric, Harley-Davidson, Hewlett-Packard, Mitsubishi Electric, Royal DutchShell, Shell Oil Company, Toyota, the United States Army, and Xerox. It offers crucial advice for line-level managers, executive leaders, internal networkers, educators, and others who are struggling to put change initiatives into practice."

9253,"Gold Dust and Gunsmoke: Tales of Gold Rush Outlaws, Gunfighters, Lawmen, and Vigilantes","Boessenecker, John",1,Hardcover,John Wiley & Sons Inc,9780471319733,1999,03,01,367,,ENG,"Gold Dust &#38; Gunsmoke One moment the California creek beds glimmered with gold; the next, the same creeks ran red with the blood of men and women defending their claims or ceding their bags of gold dust to bandits. Packed with never-before-told tales of the American frontier, Gold Dust &#38; Gunsmoke sends you galloping through the tumultuous California territory of the mid-nineteenth century, where disputes were settled with six-shooters and the lines of justice were in perpetual flux. Armed with meticulous research, John Boessenecker has a remarkable knack for finding the perfect details to capture all the color, excitement, and hullabaloo of the Gold Rush. Gold fever drew a diverse group from around the world to California. San Francisco Bay became a virtual parking lot filled with abandoned vessels whose crews had headed for the hills of the new El Dorado. Remnants of the forces fighting in the Mexican War also got in on the action. These forces included transplanted Bowery Boys, the notorious New York City street gang with ties to Tammany Hall. The Sydney Ducks, a large contingent of new arrivals from Australia&#146; s penal colony, added a bit of outlaw innovation from down under. With more than enough gold dust to go around early in the Gold Rush, crime was rare, but as the stakes rose and the easily panned gold dwindled, robbery and murder became a part of life on the frontier. Word of the San Miguel massacre rippled from mining camp to mining camp, retelling of the slaying of ten people, an entire family taken down by gunshot and ax. Settlers throughout the frontier followed the exploits of Joaquin Murrieta, the most famous Hispanic outlaw and the most notorious bandit of theGold Rush. Bandits, highwaymen, and other desperadoes cruised the frontier looking for stakes. The stories of their crimes and their confrontations with justice are recounted here, many for the first time. With virtually no police protection on the frontier, vigilance committees took justice into their own hands. Six penalties were traditionally handed down: hanging, whipping, ear-cropping, head shaving, branding, or banishment. Since few people in this transient society knew each other, vigilantes sought ways of physically marking criminals, cropping their ears or branding their cheek with an &quot; R&quot; for robber, or &quot; H.T.&quot; for horse thief. California&#146; s population swelled in these heady days, spawning dozens of saloons, gambling halls, fandango houses, and bordellos. The names of the rapidly sprouting mining camps reflected the rough society therein: Drunkard&#146; s Bar, Garrote, Hell&#146; s Delight, Whorehouse Gulch, Git Up and Git. Amusements paralleled the raucous cult of the masculinity of the West. Bare knuckle prizefighting, cock-fights, bullfights, and the brutal bull and bear fights filled the hours not spent drinking, whoring, and gambling. Published in tandem with the one hundred fiftieth anniversaries of the Gold Rush and California&#146; s statehood, these authentic stories of gunfighters, lawmen, vigilantes, and barroom brawlers comprise an important contribution to the rich lore of the American West. Chronicles the vigilante justice, fandango houses, gambling halls, love affairs, prostitutes, bare-knuckled fighting, and rough riding of California's goldrush"

Until this important new study, however, the nature of Kory&#335; society, the stresses induced by the new legislation, and society's resistance to the Neo-Confucian changes imposed by the Chos&#335;n elite have remained largely unexplored. <P>To explain which aspects of life in Kory&#335; came under attack and why, Martina Deuchler draws on social anthropology to examine ancestor worship, mourning, inheritance, marriage, the position of women, and the formation of descent groups. To examine how Neo-Confucian ideology could become an effective instrument for altering basic aspects of Kory&#335; life, she traces shifts in political and social power as well as the cumulative effect of changes over time. What emerges is a subtle analysis of Chos&#335;n Korean social and ideological history."

Even in countries such as China, where abortion is fully accessible in practice as well as in theory, our understanding of the phenomenon is very partial. The result of a global research project commissioned by the World Health Organization, this book provides new information on abortion, why it happens and what happens when it does. There are sections detailing women's perspectives and also chronicling the providers views and the effect they have on medical provision. Several essays focus on the relationship between contraception and abortion, while a section on adolescents addresses a newly emerging concern for program managers around the world. Including much previously unavailable material, this book is the most comprehensive and up-to-date picture of abortion globally.<BR>"

9336,Joseph Andrews and Shamela,"Fielding, Henry",1,Paperback,Oxford Univ Pr,9780192833433,1999,09,01,410,,ENG,"Henry Fielding wrote both Joseph Andrews (1742) and Shamela (1741) in response to Samuel Richardson's book Pamela (1740), of which Shamela is a splendidly bawdy travesty. Joseph Andrews begins as a parody, too, but soon outgrows its origins, and its deepest roots lie in Cervantes and Marivaux. In both stories, Fielding demonstrates his concern for the corruption of contemporary society, politics, religion, morality, and taste.<BR> This revised and expanded edition follows the text of Joseph Andrews established by Martin C. Battestin for the definitive Wesleyan Edition of Fielding's works. The text of Shamela is based on the first edition, and two substantial appendices reprint the preliminary matter from the second edition of Richardson's Pamela and Conyers Middleton's Life of Cicero, which is also closely parodied in Shamela. This Oxford World's Classics edition also features a new introduction by Thomas Keymer which situates Fielding's works in their critical and historical contexts."

Roskies takes the reader on a grand tour of major memory sites, each of which is built upon foundations of rebellion, rupture, and loss: chronicles of catastrophe from the Warsaw ghetto that preserve a broken covenant; the symbolic landscape of an Old World shtetl; a gallery of rabbis and zaddikim who are really rebels in disguise; a repertoire of parodic songs; a failed revolution recast into an Honor Row of magnificent tombstones; and a Holy Land where the search for sacred space is led by those least likely ever to find it. The creativity with which Jews have coped with loss and catastrophe in modern times is richly revealed in this spirited account."

And certainly in the Revuelta family she has found a source of both mystery and revelation. <BR>At its center is Naty: born in 1925, educated in the United States, a socialite during the Batista era, who after marriage to a prominent doctor and the birth of a daughter became intoxicated with Castro and his revolution (here, published for the first time, are the letters they exchanged while he was in jail). Though her husband and daughter immigrated to the United States after Castro's victory, Naty remained in Cuba to raise her second child, Castro's unacknowledged daughter, only to be ultimately confronted by his dismissive, withering judgment: ""Naty missed the train."" Her two daughters, one of whom settles well into life in America, while the other never recovers from her father's intransigent repudiation of her; her granddaughter, who Naty desperately believes will return to Cuba when--not if--Castro is removed from the island; and her mother, an unregenerate reactionary: these are the lives that complete this extraordinary story. <BR>Each of the women is irrevocably marked with a part of the island's terrible and poignant tale, and Wendy Gimbel has created a rich and intense narrative of their lives and times. Havana Dreams leaves us with an indelible impression of familial obligation and illicit love; of the heady but doomedromanticism of revolution; and of the profound consequences of Cuba's contemporary history for the ordinary and most intimate lives of its people. <P>""From the Hardcover edition."

Ravitch redirects the heated debate over prayer in the public schools. He asserts that current legal discourse, which centers this hotly contested issue around First Amendment rights, underestimates the ways in which school prayer fosters discrimination against religious minorities and dissenters. Arguing that traditional Constitutional doctrine is inadequate to address the harmful effects of public school religious exercises, Ravitch looks to civil rights principles and anti-discrimination laws for an alternative approach.<P>The author confronts the discrimination issue head-on, citing recent dramatic incidents of intimidation, harassment, and physical violence toward both religious minorities and those who oppose religious observances in the schools. He examines the legal, political, and social realities that create such occurrences, concluding that discrimination is likely to become more widespread, particularly as the religious right aggressively promotes the expansion of organized religious exercises in schools. Following a survey of current civil rights statutes and their limitations in dealing with this issue, Ravitch presents a draft of a statute that directly confronts this form of discrimination."

U.S. officials have expressed concern, for instance, about perceived problems of bilateral trade imbalances and greater market access. U.S. Direct Investment in China focuses on one aspect U.S. China trade relations -- direct investment -- and dispels some of the perceived problems. Using a new data time series on investment and trade, the authors argue that U.S. direct investment in China benefits both countries. Among the benefits to the United States is acess to the Chinese market. The authors show that, in 1993, U.S. firms in China sold 80 percent of their output directly to customers in China. Furthermore, U.S. direct investment in China also increases trade between the two countries and should significantly enhance China's economic growth in the long run. Contrary to the public's perception, the new data in the Fung, Lau, and Lee study demonstrate that U.S. direct investment in China does not take jobs away from U.S. workers. After investing in China, almost 90 percent of U.S. firms in China maintained their level of production in the United States and almost 40 percent expanded output at home. The authors also note that U.S. firms in China produced different products from those of their parent companies."

A 1998 CHOICE Outstanding Academic BookA comparison of the religious and cultural traditions of Islam and the Christian West on the meaning of war for religion.""An impressive work, which contributes to the needed dialogue between these two cultures and religions. Highly recommended."" ChoiceIn this book James Turner Johnson explores the cultural traditions of the Christian West and Islam, in an effort to encourage a constructive dialogue on the nature of war for religion. No other issue highlights the difference between these two cultures more clearly or with more relevance for their interrelations throughout history and in the contemporary world. In the West, war for religion is most often dismissed as a relic of the past, belonging to a time less rational and less civilized than our own. From this perspective, Muslims who advocate holy war are seen as religious fanatics who are supporting criminal and terrorist activity. By contrast, war for religion has an honored place in the Islamic world, associated with a perennial religious requirement: striving in the path of faith by heart, tongue, and hands. This striving is designated by the now familiar term jihad. In fact, striving by the sword is the ""lesser"" jihad, and many Muslims themselves are troubled by reductionistic appeals to jihad to justify terrorism, revolution, and anti-western activity. According to Johnson, for there to be any dialogue between Islam and the West we must understand that in the West religion and politics are placed in separate spheres, while normative Islam regards religion as properly integral to the political order. From this perspective religious concerns should have a place in statecraft, including the useof military force.Three questions form the heart of Johnsons inquiry: Is there a legitimate justification for war for religion? What authority is required? What is the proper conduct in such wars? In each case, he asks the question by comparing religious wars with other kinds of wars. The picture that emerges is of war for religion not as an expression of fanatical excess but as a controlled, purposeful activity. With an eye to the present day, Johnson examines cases in history where distinctive models of war for religion were implemented by rulers. This in turn sets the stage for critical judgment on contemporary appeals to the idea of jihad in relation to political aims.Well known for his work on peace and just war, Johnson draws upon a wide base of historical and comparative scholarship. While the book is anchored primarily on the past, on the roots and historical development of the two traditions, his aim throughout is to shed light on contemporary attitudes, ideals, and behaviors, especially as they bear on real problems that affect relations between Western and Islamic cultures in the world today."

Time is the veiled notion that underlies Serres's many epistemological parables and fables, and is a consistent metaphor throughout his work. Assad uncovers this common thread through a sustained discussion of certain key concepts in chaos theory and nonlinear dynamics, and these concepts come into focus as she continues her detailed readings of Serres's texts, demonstrating close analogies in his work to the discourses of science, literature, and philosophy."

The French original, Le Roman de la Rose, had a profound influence on Chaucer, who says he translated the work. From the sixteenth century to the mid-nineteenth, scholars assumed that the Romaunt comprised large fragments of that translation. Subsequent debates have divided the Romaunt into two or three segments, and proffered arguments that Chaucer was responsible for one or more of them, or for none. The current consensus is that he almost certainly wrote the first 1,705 lines.<P>Charles Dahlberg's edition of the Romaunt provides a full summary of scholarship on the question of authorship as well as other important topics, including a useful survey of the influence of the French poem on Chaucer."

Throughout, he explores the intertwined themes of freedom and servitude, city and countryside, and work, religion, and resistance that shaped black life in the region through two and a half centuries.<P>Hodges chronicles the lives of the first free black settlers in the Dutch-ruled city, the gradual slide into enslavement after the British takeover, the fierce era of slavery, and the painfully slow process of emancipation. He pays particular attention to the black religious experience in all its complexity and to the vibrant slave culture that was shaped on the streets and in the taverns. Together, Hodges shows, these two potent forces helped fuel the long and arduous pilgrimage to liberty."

In specifying the internal microstructure of a material the chemistry, the crystallography, and the structural morphology need to be considered. For each of these aspects, there are three equally important stages of investigation -- specimen preparation, image observation and recording, and the analysis and interpretation of recorded data. Microstructural Characterization of Matenals is an integrated treatment of the science of microstructural characterization which emphasizes the interaction of the specimen with the radiation used to probe the microstructure. The three main aspects of microstructural morphology, phase identification and crystallography, and microanalysis of the chemical composition are all covered in detail. Following an introductory chapter, the principal methods of characterization which are commonly available in a well-equipped laboratory are treated in full. These include diffraction analysis, optical microscopy, electron microscopy, and chemical microanalytical techniques. Microstructural Characterization of Materials will be of great value to both undergraduate and graduate students and includes suitable problems for students exercises. More advanced researchers will also find it highly useful as a general reference source."

Balancing the tasks of managing staff, working with volunteers, providing services or spiritual assistance, and raising funds is a difficult and often frustrating endeavor. Faith-based organizations also have to operate in the secular world of funding, regulations, marketing, competition, and cash flow. All of these demands can tax even the best managers. Yet amazingly, until now, there were no professional resources geared exclusively to the concerns of leaders and managers of faith-based organizations. The first and only guide of its kind, Faith-Based Management arms you with the knowledge and skills you need to successfully manage your place of worship or faith-based service organization. Drawing upon his many years of experience as a trainer and consultant who has worked with hundreds of organizations nationwide, Peter Brinckerhoff explores the unique demands and common pitfalls that beset faith-based managers. Writing in a congenial, highly accessible style, he identifies the seven major characteristics shared by all successful faith-based organizations and shows you how to assess the strengths and weaknesses of your organization&#146; s management in each category. Using numerous real-world case studies and examples to illustrate his points, he describes proven faith-based management strategies and techniques that you can put to work immediately in your organization. And he provides clear-cut, easy-to-follow guidelines on how to manage for excellence in all crucial areas, including staff recruitment and management, financial stewardship, leadership, marketing, strategic planning, and more.Faith-Based Management is an indispensable hands-on resource for leaders, board members, managers of places of worship, faith-based service organizations, and faith-centered foundations."

9688,Monument in a Summer Hat,"Armstrong, James",1,Paperback,New Issues Poetry Press,9780932826787,1999,10,01,53,,ENG,"  In James Armstrong's pellucid poetry the drifting of autumn leaves shares space with the baroque architecture of nineteenth century England. A woman peruses a book of pharmaceuticals in a coffee shop looking for hints of happiness. And a naked woman wearing hip boots stares out of the 1940s in a photograph hung in a Michigan bar. Twilight is always moving the shadows of our urban lives out toward the country, our inherited past, where a deer or a heron waits like an angel glimpsed through the fog. Armstrong's poems elucidate the mystery and beauty of borders -- temporal and historical, as well as geographical -- while his pastoral sensibility floods our senses with images of the natural world, seemingly stopping time, edifying us, and helping us -- for a few moments anyway -- to transcend our enervated contemporary lives. Reading this book is like diving into a deep lake. It cleanses the soul."

The author recounts the dramatic search for and discovery of a proof of a counting formula conjectured in the late 1970s: the number of n x n alternating sign matrices, objects that generalize permutation matrices. While it was apparent that the conjecture must be true, the proof was elusive. As a result, researchers became drawn to this problem and made connections to aspects of the invariant theory of Jacobi, Sylvester, Cayley, MacMahon, Schur, and Young; to partitions and plane partitions; to symmetric functions; to hypergeometric and basic hypergeometric series; and, finally, to the six-vertex model of statistical mechanics. This volume is accessible to anyone with a knowledge of linear algebra, and it includes extensive exercises and Mathematica programs to help facilitate personal exploration. Students will learn what mathematicians actually do in an interesting and new area of mathematics, and even researchers in combinatorics will find something unique within Proofs and Confirmations."

He explains his involvement in Philadelphia's radical republican politics and the difficulties this caused his family.

As the original short-term vehicle, the futures market allows the trader to collapse the time frame in which he or she can reach the desired profit target-or pain threshold. As a result, wins and losses are compounded much more quickly than in stock trading-and, in the case of wins, often more profitably. The ability to gain leverage with very little on margin gives you, the trader, the ability to earn more off smaller swings. And enough home runs could allow you to become your own boss, work from home in your bathrobe, or even work from your cell phone while lying on the beach. So far, so good. But what does it take to win? <BR> In Day Trade Futures Online, award-winning veteran futures trader Larry Williams gives a no-holds-barred view of the risks and rewards of this increasingly accessible arena. His straightforward approach to helping you determine your trading personality is the first step. Then he offers traders what they really need: strategies and tactics designed to beat the futures markets. From hardware and software setup to trading psychology and successful strategizing, this highly readable book covers all the bases needed to prepare you to trade online, including: <BR> * Assessing your risk threshold<BR> * Streamlining the glut of trading and price information to make it work for you<BR> * The importance of knowing how to manage your money<BR> * Choosing an online broker and utilizing other onlineresources, such as news, chat rooms, and message boards<BR> * When to get out of your trades<BR> * Building a system based on Larry's time-tested strategies <BR> . . . and that's just for starters.

Blockley considers the functions of four of the most common and most syntactically important words in Old English, as well as such features of clauses as verb-initial order, negative contraction, and unexpressed but understood subjects. Picking up where Bruce Mitchell's classic Old English Syntax left off, Blockley shows how such common words and structures mark the relationships between phrases and clauses.<P>Blockley also considers how the poetic tradition compensated for the loss in written texts of the syntactic functions served by intonation and inflection. Arguing that verse relied instead on a prescriptively regulated, unambiguous syntax, she suggests principles that promise more complex and subtle interpretations of familiar texts such as Beowulf as well as a wealth of other Old English writings."

By studying the lives of wartime Americans, as well as nursery schools, elementary and secondary schools, and universities, Charles Dorn makes the case that although wartime pressures affected educational institutions to varying degrees, these institutions resisted efforts to be placed solely in service of the nation's war machine. Instead, Dorn argues, American education maintained a sturdy commitment to fostering civic mindedness in a society characterized by rapid technological advance and the perception of an ever-increasing threat to national security."
